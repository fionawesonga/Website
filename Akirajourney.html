<p> My first week of AkiraChix was feeled with mixed emotions.It was bitter-sweet kind of emotions.A little bitter emotion because I knew I was embarking on ajourney away from my family for a whole year.<span>Despite all thhat i  was super excited to join a school which we be a bridge to achieving my dreams.I still remember my first step inside the AkiraChix compound,i was welcomed by extra friendly faces which was something not so much expected in a school.I was so excited about the new things i was going to learn.We checked into our hostel and i was even more surprised to realize i had fellow students from different ethnicities.</span></p>
<span>The admision was quite simple and easy for me as I had so much help from the former students.The staff too was so friendly and i must say it so easy to settle and not feel homesick
<span>There are so many things i was learning already about AkiraChix.
    <span>The most valuable lesson i'm learning each day is to bre selfdriven,accountable and hardworking each day as the sun rises.some of the things i love most include:</span>
<ul> <li>The hospitality of everyonen in the school.</li><li>The clean nature of everything in the school compound.</li><li>The presence of very professional teachers who teach well.</li><li>The good food they prepare.</li><li>The diversity of people from different cultures.</li><li>The mentorship we receive from Linda and the whole administration.</li></ul>
<P>We are all driven by innovative principles.My end goal is to graduate with flying colours.</P>

<p>However there also exists things that have not been so good have been:</p>
<ul><li>Adjusting to time schedules-I have faulted alot when it comes to catching up with time for example missing assignment submission.</li><li>The cold weather condition of the region.</li><li>Uncorparative members when it comes to groupwork.</li></ul>
<p>With all these experiences i'm hoping to create the best version of myself from AkiraChix.I want to be part of <a href="https://africanwomenintech.com/">africanwomenintech.com.</a>
